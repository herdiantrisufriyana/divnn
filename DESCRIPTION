Description: This package facilitates application of DeepInsight (DI) and
    Visible Neural Network (VNN) algorithms from Alok Sharma and Michael Ku Yu,
    respectively. The application is intended for supervised machine learning
    by convolutional neural network (CNN). DeepInsight converts non-image
    data into image-like data by dimensionality reduction algorithms. This
    package maps the data into a multi-dimensional array. Meanwhile, VNN
    determines a neural network architecture by hierarchical clustering
    algorithms, particularly for data-driven ontology. This package generate a
    CNN model based on the ontology using the DeepInsight array as the input.
    However, this package includes neither dimensionality reduction nor
    data-driven ontology inference. A comprehensive guide to orchestrate this
    package and other packages to develop the DI-VNN model is described in this
    package vignette. The inputs are instance-feature value data frame, outcome
    vector, feature similarity matrix, feature three-dimensional mapping matrix,
    and ontology source-target-similarity-relation data frame. The outputs are
    tidy (expression) set, training array, and Keras CNN model.
